Video Categories with Subcategories
The API now supports hierarchical video categories with subcategories.

API Endpoint: GET /api/video-categories

How it works:

Categories with parentCategoryId: null are main categories (top-level)
Categories with a parentCategoryId value are subcategories that belong to that parent
How to display:

First, show only main categories (where parentCategoryId is null)
When user selects/expands a main category, show its subcategories (where parentCategoryId matches the selected category's id)
Subcategories should be visually indented or styled differently (e.g., with a "└" prefix or different color)
Videos belong to categories via their categoryId field - this can be either a main category or subcategory
Example Response:

[
  { "id": "cat-1", "name": "Stories", "parentCategoryId": null },
  { "id": "cat-2", "name": "Short Stories", "parentCategoryId": "cat-1" },
  { "id": "cat-3", "name": "Long Stories", "parentCategoryId": "cat-1" },
  { "id": "cat-4", "name": "Music", "parentCategoryId": null }
]
In this example, "Stories" and "Music" are main categories. "Short Stories" and "Long Stories" are subcategories under "Stories".

Background Audio/Video Playback Requirements
IMPORTANT: The app MUST support background playback for both audio and video content.

Audio Playback:

Audio files (albums, tracks) should continue playing when the app is in the background
Audio should continue playing when the device screen is locked
Use appropriate audio session category:
iOS: AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback
Android: MediaSession
Video Playback:

Videos should support Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode
When user leaves the app or locks the screen, video audio should continue playing
iOS: Enable Background Modes → Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture
Android: Use MediaSession API and enable PiP in manifest
Implementation Notes:

Enable background audio capabilities in app configuration
Handle audio interruptions gracefully (phone calls, other apps)
Show media controls in lock screen and notification center
Support remote control events (play, pause, skip) from headphones/car bluetooth
